## Machine Learning Algorithms

### **Supervised Learning**
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values based on input features.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees**: Splits data into branches to make predictions.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the optimal boundary between classes.
- **Neural Networks**: Mimics the human brain to solve complex problems.

### **Unsupervised Learning**
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data into clusters based on similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving variance.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree-like structure for data grouping.

### **Ensemble Methods**
- **Random Forest**: Combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Sequentially improves predictions by correcting errors.

### **Deep Learning**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for image data.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Processes sequential data like time series.

### **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Q-Learning**: Learns optimal actions by maximizing rewards.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks.
