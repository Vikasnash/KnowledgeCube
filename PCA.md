Let's delve into Principal Component Analysis (PCA) step by step in mathematical detail. PCA is essentially a linear algebra technique that transforms a dataset to a new coordinate system, where the axes (principal components) correspond to the directions of maximum variance in the data. Here's how it works:

---

### Step 1: Organize the Data into a Matrix
Let the dataset have \( m \) observations (data points) and \( n \) variables (features). Arrange the dataset into a matrix \( X \) of size \( m \times n \), where:
- Each row represents an observation.
- Each column represents a variable.

For example, if we have a dataset of \( 5 \) observations and \( 3 \) features:
X =
| x_11 | x_12 | x_13 |
|------|------|------|
| x_21 | x_22 | x_23 |
| x_31 | x_32 | x_33 |
| x_41 | x_42 | x_43 |
| x_51 | x_52 | x_53 |



---

### Step 2: Mean-Center the Data
For each variable (column), calculate the mean and subtract it from the corresponding column. This ensures that the data is centered around zero.

Let the mean of the \( j \)-th column be:
\[
\mu_j = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m x_{ij}
\]

The centered data matrix \( X_{\text{centered}} \) is:
\[
X_{\text{centered}} = X - \mu
\]

---

### Step 3: Compute the Covariance Matrix
The covariance matrix \( C \) is an \( n \times n \) symmetric matrix that shows the pairwise covariances between variables:
\[
C = \frac{1}{m - 1} X_{\text{centered}}^T X_{\text{centered}}
\]

Each entry \( c_{ij} \) of \( C \) represents the covariance between the \( i \)-th and \( j \)-th variables:
\[
c_{ij} = \frac{1}{m - 1} \sum_{k=1}^m (x_{ki} - \mu_i)(x_{kj} - \mu_j)
\]

---

### Step 4: Perform Eigen Decomposition
Perform eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix \( C \). This gives:
- **Eigenvalues (\( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n \))**: Represent the amount of variance captured by each principal component.
- **Eigenvectors (\( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \))**: Represent the directions (axes) of the principal components.

For the covariance matrix \( C \), solve the equation:
\[
Cv = \lambda v
\]
where:
- \( v \) is the eigenvector.
- \( \lambda \) is the corresponding eigenvalue.

---

### Step 5: Sort Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Order the eigenvalues in descending order: \( \lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \dots \geq \lambda_n \).
- Arrange the eigenvectors to match the order of their eigenvalues.

This step ensures that the principal components are ranked by the amount of variance they explain.

---

### Step 6: Select Top \( k \) Principal Components
Choose the top \( k \) eigenvectors (those corresponding to the largest eigenvalues). These eigenvectors form the **projection matrix** \( W \):
\[
W = \begin{bmatrix}
v_1 & v_2 & \dots & v_k
\end{bmatrix}
\]

---

### Step 7: Project the Data
Transform the original data \( X_{\text{centered}} \) onto the new \( k \)-dimensional space using the projection matrix \( W \):
\[
X_{\text{reduced}} = X_{\text{centered}} W
\]

Here:
- \( X_{\text{reduced}} \) is the reduced dataset in the \( k \)-dimensional space.
- Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables.

---

### Summary of Mathematical Flow:
1. Start with \( X \) (original dataset).
2. Compute \( X_{\text{centered}} = X - \mu \) (mean-centered data).
3. Calculate \( C = \frac{1}{m-1} X_{\text{centered}}^T X_{\text{centered}} \) (covariance matrix).
4. Solve \( Cv = \lambda v \) (eigen decomposition).
5. Select top \( k \) eigenvectors (principal components).
6. Transform the data: \( X_{\text{reduced}} = X_{\text{centered}} W \).
